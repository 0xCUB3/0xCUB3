# Hi :) -- I'm Alexander

I'm an undergraduate at MIT, working toward a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. Currently researching and coding at MIT CSAIL ([Mantis AI](https://home.withmantis.com/)), doing a lot of thinking, coding, and sometimes breaking stuff. Outside of school, I enjoy building and sharing tools to make life a little bit easier.
